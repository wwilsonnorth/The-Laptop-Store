# The-Laptop-Store

This project was built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course.

A simple looking Laptop Store built using Node.js to show a range of laptops that showed me how powerful Node.js is in interacting with HTML files. To run this project, please follow the instructions below:

- Clone the repo or download the ZIP to your machine.
- Open project using your preferred code editor and open the Terminal at the root folder.
- Download the most updated version of Node.js from their website. If you already have Node installed, check you have the up to date version by running ```node -v``` in the terminal.
- Install nodemon through the terminal by running ```npm install nodemon -g```. If you are on Mac, you may need to add ```sudo``` at the beginning of the command.
- Now that nodemon is running, go to your browser and type ```127.0.0.1:1337``` to view The Laptop Store.
